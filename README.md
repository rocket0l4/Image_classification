# Image_classification
Classifying the Animals Images by using TensorFlow with (95% - Accuracy)

The notebook appears to include the following key sections:

  Introduction and Setup:
            Link to the Colab notebook.
            Data preparation, including downloading and unzipping the dataset from Kaggle.
    
  Libraries Import:
            Necessary libraries like TensorFlow/Keras, file management tools, and visualization libraries.
    
  Dataset Analysis:
            Obtaining class names and counting the classes.
            Examining class distribution.
    
  Model Training:
            Likely multiple TensorFlow/Keras models for image classification.
    
  Evaluation and Visualization:
            Metrics, confusion matrices, or result visualization.

I will now draft a README file based on these observations. ​

README for Image Classification Project
Project Overview

This project focuses on image classification using a dataset of animals obtained from Kaggle. The primary goal is to explore various TensorFlow/Keras models and evaluate their performance in classifying images into multiple categories.
